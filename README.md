# BallReactionTime-p5js

This is a simple game created using p5js' web editor. Essentially, several moving balls will appear in the middle of the screen, and the user must quickly hover over all of the green ones as fast as possible. If you hover over a red one or all of the balls go out of bounds, then you lose. If you successfully hover over all of the green ones, then you win. You only have a few seconds before the balls go off screen, so you better be quick!
